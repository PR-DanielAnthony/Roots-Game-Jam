# Roots-Game-Jam
A project created in Global Game Jam. My role as one of the programmers was to implement surface detection and projectile mechanics.

#Original Description
You are a mushroom jumping through platforms. Every time you die you become roots.

The roots persist across deaths, which become platforms you can walk on.
These platforms shield you from the obstacles that have killed you before.

You are looking for your mushroom network, trying to reconnect your fungal self to your fungal family 

Levels get harder by having more traps. You have to figure our the best places to die, because you only have a limited number of re-spores. 

The game is over when you finish all of the levels.
